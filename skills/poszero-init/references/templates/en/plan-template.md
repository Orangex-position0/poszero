## Workflow Profile

- Level: standard | deep
- Review Mode: consolidated | checkpointed
- Validation Mode: batch-contract-check | independent

## Inputs

## Summary

## Technical Context

- Runtime / Language:
- Primary Dependencies / Tools:
- Data / Storage: N/A unless relevant
- Relevant Paths:
- Validation:
- Compatibility Constraints:
- Performance / Scale Constraints: N/A unless relevant

Use `NEEDS DECISION: [specific question]` only when missing information changes the implementation direction. Otherwise, proceed with a reasonable default.

## Implementation Approach

## Complexity Tracking

Fill only when the approach introduces a new abstraction, dependency, service/module, storage, async queue/worker, multi-stage migration, or non-trivial compatibility layer.

| Complexity | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| --- | --- | --- |

## System Architecture

Fill only when the work changes cross-module boundaries, service boundaries, data flow, storage ownership, external interfaces, or runtime/deployment boundaries.

Use these prompts only when relevant:

- What domain boundaries matter?
- What data flows across boundaries?
- Which approved Spec API contracts are affected, and which modules implement them? Reference the contract rather than restating it.
- Who owns storage or durable state?
- What runtime/deployment boundaries constrain the design?
- What cross-module dependencies are allowed or forbidden?

## Program Design

Fill only when the work changes code structure.

Allowed:

- Key types or interfaces by responsibility
- Important method signatures only when they constrain collaboration
- Module boundaries
- Call sequence for non-trivial flows
- Error handling and validation strategy

Do not include full function bodies, step-by-step pseudocode, incidental helper names, or speculative abstractions.

Discuss in dependency order when relevant; reuse settled answers rather than repeating questions:

1. Which modules are needed, and what does each own?
2. Which key data models and functions belong to each module?
3. Which inputs, outputs, and signatures constrain collaboration? Skip incidental functions.
4. How do modules call or coordinate with each other?

Record only decisions needed to guide implementation; this is not a script requiring a separate question for each step.

## Project Structure

Fill only when this work adds, moves, or redefines files/directories. Use real target paths only.

[real target paths only]

**Structure Decision**:

## Protocol Check

- [ ] Spec contains Why / What / Observable Contract / Constraints only.
- [ ] Plan owns implementation approach, architecture, program design, and slice order.
- [ ] Vertical slices are independently implementable, integrable, and verifiable.
- [ ] Complexity Tracking is filled when added complexity requires justification.
- [ ] Repository routing, mirror, install, and verification rules are satisfied or not applicable.

## Vertical Slices

A vertical slice is an independently implementable, integrable, and verifiable end-to-end increment. `plan.md` defines slice order and boundaries; `tasks.md` expands execution steps, checks, and commands.

| Order | Slice | Outcome | Depends On |
