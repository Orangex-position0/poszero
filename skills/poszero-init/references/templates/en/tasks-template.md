## Workflow Profile

- Level: standard | deep
- Review Mode: consolidated | checkpointed
- Validation Mode: batch-contract-check | independent

## Inputs

- `spec.md`
- `plan.md`
- `research.md` if present
- `data-model.md` if present
- `contracts/` if present

Generated task documents must replace all placeholders and must not keep template-only guidance.

## Task Grain Rules

Each task must have a clear change scope, be verifiable when complete, avoid hidden dependency on unrelated layer work, avoid mechanical steps such as creating a file or importing a type, and avoid vague work such as implementing a whole subsystem.

Each implementation task must include the target file path when code, template, or documentation changes are expected.

## Task Quality Gate

| Slice | Task | Acceptance Check | Verification Command |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

`Verification Command` may be `N/A - docs only`, but `Acceptance Check` must still be specific. Task-related tests and required local regression checks must pass before a task is Done or locally committed; record commands and results in Implementation Evidence.

## Tasks

| ID | Status | Slice | Task | Acceptance Check | Verification Command | Depends On | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

`Status` values: `todo`, `doing`, `done`, `blocked`.
`Depends On` must reference task IDs or be `None`.
